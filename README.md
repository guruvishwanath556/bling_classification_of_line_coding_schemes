This MATLAB project is designed to identify the type of digital line coding scheme used in a given binary signal. It analyzes waveform characteristics such as polarity levels, zero levels, transition patterns, and PAPR (Peak-to-Average Power Ratio) to differentiate between common encoding techniques like Manchester, NRZ, AMI, etc.

While the script includes code to generate and plot different line coding waveforms, its primary purpose is to support the automatic detection of the line coding type based on waveform analysis.
